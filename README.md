- Creating world heatmap
  - [Datamaps](http://datamaps.github.io/)
  - Heatmap depends on Reddit's post date(on scale of 1-7) + the number of votes; formula = 1-(n/7). Past 24 hours news should create the initial heatmap first based on votes, and from their a ratio can be taken for the amount of heat the older news will get.
- Creating submaps for each country, with headlines and links to articles and reddit discusions
  - Again, this should be a heatmap based on the previously stated logic.
- Potential ideas
  - Tags' maps, not just location maps. Doesn't have to be a heatmap though.
- Digital Ocean
  - Python3 and Docker...
